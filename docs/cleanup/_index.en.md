```sh
cd /home/ec2-user/environment/recommender-system-dev-workshop-code/scripts
./clean-online.sh
```

{{% notice info %}}
This will take about 20 minutes to release resources
{{% /notice %}}

2. offline cleanup

``` 
cd /home/ec2-user/environment/recommender-system-dev-workshop-code/scripts
./clean-offline.sh
```
